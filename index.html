            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Chloe Nott. I attended the University of Washington and majored in Physics with a minor in Applied Computational Math Sciences. I was then an R&D and then manufacturing engineer for about seven years after that. The company I worked for made pressure sensors. Very high pressure, high temperature capable, vibration resistant sensors was our specialization. My main function was process control. If there was a manufacturing change or problem that affected a large portion of the product we made, I'd probably be the person to take that project. I also handled short term miscellaneous tasks that fit my unique experience set. 
                <br><br>
                One of my goals is to do the something similar to my previous job, except utilizing software to cause positive changes to people, rather than utilizing engineering techniques to cause positive changes to products. I don't know what opportunities already exist that work towards that purpose. One example hypothetical opportunty I'd be interested working for would be in a company that has a product goal to make a streamlined implementation of very large scale DMAIC/PDCA for depression.
